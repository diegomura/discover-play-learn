# Discover, Play, Learn

The goal of this site is to serve as a personal (yet public) playground for exploring the topics I've been reading about and to have some fun, as well as a place to store references and perhaps some accompanying notes.

Don't expect anything on this site to make any sense! Topics may not even be related to each other or categorized within the field of Computer Science. I have no plans for it, and I might abandon it after a few days. Who knows what the future holds.
